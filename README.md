# silver-and-gold



## TODO

1. this bot joins a set of top channels and prevents people who aren’t #gold from posting
2. this bot puts everyone into a #silver channel
3. if you post images or links without having #gold, it will replace your post with an image and message about "#gold status required" or similar
4. you have to collab with a hack clubber to fix this. to get from #silver to #gold, you must be the person to type “17” after numbers 1 through 16 are typed, but only if you didn’t type 15 or 16
5. #gold doesn’t actually exist. SURPRISE! when you do the above challenge in #silver, you get dropped down to #bronze because we are some trolls
6. #bronze has our Support Cow who you may speak with about this “issue” of being downgraded instead of upgraded (oh no! our bad)

* this bot doesn't bother personal channels
* this bot requires consent and does not spam workspace members with notifications
* an announcement will be made that prompts people to do something that consents to this
* ideally this bot will get triggered by a user setting their status to something in particular. if that's annoying to do (we don't have TOO much time for this), then reacting with a certain emoji to the announcement message will be sufficient as consent to trigger a user into this feature/troll
